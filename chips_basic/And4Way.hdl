/** 4-Way And **/
//The 4 Way And chip returns true if all 4 inputs are true
//If (a==b==c==d) then (out=1), else (out=0).

PARTS:

//First we check that both a and b are true

//Then we check whether a and b and c are true

//Lastly we check if a and b and c and d are true, and if they are we return true.

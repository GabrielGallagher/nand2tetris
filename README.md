Building a computer from first principles

The objective of this project is to integrate key notions from algorithms, computer 
architecture, operating systems, compilers, and software engineering in one unified framework. 
This will be done constructively, by building a general-purpose computer system from the ground 
up. In the process, I will explore many ideas and techniques used in the design of modern 
hardware and software systems. The project will be a journey from the bare bone details of 
switching circuits to the high level abstraction of object-based software design.
